# Week 1 Challange

## Purpose

This website is the result of a code refactor assignment to test skills and understanding of basic CSS and HTML formatting.
Additionally, semantic elements were placed to increase the accessability of the website.

By consolidating redundant code it is now cleaner and easier to decipher while maintaining the same layout on the user end.

This project was mostly done independantly, however peers Carly Staheli & Josh Davis were involved in a review process.
